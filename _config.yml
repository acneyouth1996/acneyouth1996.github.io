  Hi, I'm Yong Huang. Here are 10 things about me
  I grew up in the northeast of China 
  My best childhood memories include railways trips, chunbing(春饼), and one unique flavor of ice cream that now I cannot find again 
  I moved back to where I was born when I was old enough for school
  * I was pretty into these things when I was a teenager, roller skating, pool and cult movies.
  * I broke my left arm when I was 15, and I grow 2 inches in height during the recovery.
  * I did my undergrad at Tongji University in Shanghai, the campus is breathtakingly beautiful.
  * I was in Canada in 2016, it is cold but sweet, I wish I made more friends.
  * I am doing a master in NYC, NYC is great except for the subway and New York Knicks. (Now I am adding COVID-19 to this list)
  * I love movies and cinemas. 
  * I am about to relocate to Southern California.
