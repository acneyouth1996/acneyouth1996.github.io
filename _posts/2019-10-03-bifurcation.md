## Saddle-Node bifurcation


### Intro:

In the mathematical area of bifurcation theory a saddle-node bifurcation is a local bifurcation in which two fixed points (or equilibria) of a dynamical system collide and annihilate each other.
If the phase space is one-dimensional, one of the equilibrium points is unstable (the saddle), while the other is stable (the node).


### Normal form:

A typical example of a differential equation with a saddle-node bifurcation is:
$$
\frac{d x}{d t}=r+x^{2}
$$

Here $$x$$ is the state variable and $$r$$ is the bifurcation parameter.

- If $$r<0$$ there are two equilibrium points, a stable equilibrium point at $$-\sqrt{-r}$$ and an unstable one at $$+\sqrt{-r}$$.

- At $$r=0$$ (the bifurcation point) there is exactly one equilibrium point. At this point the fixed point is no longer hyperbolic. In this case the fixed point is called a saddle-node fixed point.

- If $$r>0$$ there are no equilibrium points



### Example in higher dimensions


An example of a saddle-node bifurcation in two dimensions occurs in the two-dimensional dynamical system:
$$
\begin{aligned} \frac{d x}{d t} &=\alpha-x^{2} \\ \frac{d y}{d t} &=-y \end{aligned}
$$
