## Saddle-Node bifurcation
1. Intro:
In the mathematical area of bifurcation theory a saddle-node bifurcation is a local bifurcation in which two fixed points (or equilibria) of a dynamical system collide and annihilate each other.
If the phase space is one-dimensional, one of the equilibrium points is unstable (the saddle), while the other is stable (the node).
2. Normal form:
A typical example of a differential equation with a saddle-node bifurcation is:
$$
\frac{d x}{d t}=r+x^{2}
$$

Here $$x$$ is the state variable and $$r$$ is the bifurcation parameter.
