## Problem setting
For binary question, the question we need to answer is that given a sample $$x$$, what is the proabability that the label of it is 1.


## Assumption
Can we view sigmoid function output as the proabability of y=1? yes ! It is true under the assumption that every given class, the conditional distribution of the variable is Guassian and the standard deviation are the same. 

## Proof
