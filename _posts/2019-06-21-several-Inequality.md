Let $$Z_{1}, \ldots, Z_{m}$$ be an i.i.d. sequence of random variables and let $$\mu$$ be their mean.
The strong law of large numbers states that when $$m$$ tends to infinity, the empirical average, $$
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} Z_{i}
$$, converges to the expected value $$\mu$$, with probability 1
Measure concentration inequalities quantify the deviation of the empirical average from the expectation when $$m$$ is finite.
