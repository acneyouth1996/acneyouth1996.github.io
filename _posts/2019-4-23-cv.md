## Lighting
* The appearance of light depends on its power spectrum
* Rods and cones are non-uniformly distributed on the retina, Rods responsible for intensity, cones responsible for color
* The apparent brightness depends on the surrounding regio
* Light response is nonlinear
* we sense light intensity on a logarithmic scale
* rods and cones adapt to be more sensitive in low light, less sensitive in bright light.
* Rods and cones act as filters on the spectrum
* To get the output of a filter, multiply its response curve by the spectrum, integrate over all wavelengths<br>

## Modeling Image Formation
* $$ I = kd \cdot N \cdot L$$, where N is the surface normal, I is the image intensity and L is the ligth direction.

* There are 3 kinds of reflectance:<br>
    - Ideal diffuse(Lambertian)
    - Ideal specular
    - Directional diffuse

## Photometric stereo
* setting: camera are at a fixed position but the lighting directions are different and known.
* We can directly measure angle between normal and light source<br>

* More than three lights yeild better results
* What can we go from here? we can calculate depth using normal.
* Normals are like the “derivative” of the true depth.
* one method to this problem is Normal Integration.
* we can also formulate as a linear system and solve for depths that best agree with the surface normals
  
## Multi-view stereo

* Problem formulation: given several images of the same object or scene, compute a representation of its 3D shape
* Input: calibrated images from several viewpoints (known intrinsics and extrinsics)
* Output: 3D object model

## Plane-Sweep Stereo

## Structure from motion

* two view: Solve for Fundamental matrix / Essential matrix, Factorize into intrinsics, rotation, and translation
* three view: The geometry of three views is described by a 3 x 3 x 3 tensor called the trifocal tensor
* four view: The geometry of four views is described by a 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 tensor called the quadrifocal tensor
* more than this is complicated: Instead, we explicitly solve for camera poses and scene geometry.
* Input: images with points in correspondence $$p_{i,j} = (u_{i,j},v_{i,j})$$
* Output: 3D location xi for each point pi, camera parameters Rj, tj possibly K
