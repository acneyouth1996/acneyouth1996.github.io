1. Definition:

- utility fuctions: 
$u_{1}$, $u_{2}$ for each of the players, where $u_{i}(a_{1}, a_{2})$ denotes the
utility (i.e., “score”) of player i in the outcome where player 1 chose the action
$a_{1}$ and player 2 chose $a_{2}$

- Normal-form games:

- Action profile: 


2. Some notations

- Let [n] = [1, 2, . . . , n];
- Given an action set A, let A−i denote the set of actions for everyone but player i (formally, A−i = ×j6=iAj );
- Similarly, given an action profile ~a, let a−i denote the action profile of everyone but player i;
- We will use (ai, a−i) to describe the full action profile where player i plays ai and everyone else a−i;
- To simplify notation, we sometimes directly specify u as a function from A → Rn (i.e., a function from outcomes to a vector of utilities where component i specifies the utility of player i).
